Fake News Detection
Implemented a project to detect fake news articles from multiple websites using different classification algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees,
Random Forest, DNN, SVM) using Rapid Miner. Generated a Deep learning model by using TF-IDF statistical measure with an accuracy of 81.57%.
Preprocessed the documents using techniques like Tokenization, Filter stop words, and stemming to reduce the attribute count by 37.5%.
